A proprietary device driver is a closed-source device driver published
only in binary code. In the context of free and
open-source software, a closed-source device driver is referred to as
a blob or binary blob. The term usually refers to
a closed-source kernel module loaded into the kernel of an
open-source operating system, and is sometimes also applied to code
running outside the kernel, such as system firmware images, microcode
updates, or userland programs.
