Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. In your own words, describe encapsulation.
--> Encapsulation like packaging with the functions/methods that use the that data.

2. What is a benefit of using a property instead of just having a setter function (e.g., set_angle(45))?
--> One of properties is that they are syntactically identical to attribute access, so you can change from
--> one to another without any changes to the code.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> I liked the information about trees and navigating them.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I had a lot of trouble with images not rendering in the asteroids game. I chatted with several
--> people but we were never able to figure it out. Still broken - please help.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> I am not sure where a tree would be used in real coding apart from maybe system navigation. Any ideas?

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 hr
Checkpoint A - 0.5 hr
Checkpoint B - 0.75 hr
