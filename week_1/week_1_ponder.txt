Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work 
for this class this week?
    This week was not super insightful since I have done some work with
    Python previously. I am excited to learn more though since I am not
    great at programming in this language yet. 

2. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or 
reached out for help.
    Jash had a question about which text editor to use and I let him know
    that pyCharm was an option that I have experience with. 

3. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, 
or would like to learn more about?
    Nothing currently, but I'm sure there will be some soon. 

4. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2hr
Checkpoint A - 5min
Checkpoint B - 10min
Prove Assignment - 2hr
