Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. Give a specific example of a time when you might want to override a method from a base class.
--> One example of this could be a class created to read and output the text for a file. The child class
--> might be created to read in another language file and then add a translation of the text.

2. Do you think IS-A or HAS-A is a better choice for the team activity (Circles and Points)? Why?
--> IS-A - this seems to require less coding but looking at the class,
--> it is a little harder to see what is happening.
--> HAS-A - this requires more code but the origin of the methods is far
--> more clear. Allows for more than one instance of Point for example.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> Nothing really - it was good to get more practice with with classes and inheritance.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I posted "Anyone have the skeet working? My rifle is pointing the wrong way"
--> I ended up solving this myself. The starter code was wrong (someone with access to the repo should fix that).

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> It would have been nice to be prepared to build the entire skeet program, not just part of it.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 hr
Checkpoint A - 2 hr
Checkpoint B - 2 hr
Team Activity - 1 hr
Data Structures Homework - 3 hr
Prove Assignment - 6 hr
