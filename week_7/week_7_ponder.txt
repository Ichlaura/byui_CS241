Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. Take a minute to search the Internet for an explanation of "polymorphism". You might especially consider
sources such as StackOverflow and Wikipedia. After reading through some of these, in your own words, describe
polymorphism AND why it's useful.
--> Polymorphism is the idea that something can take different forms. In programming, this appears when an object
--> can have several differing implementations - each one adapted to handle a task in a specific way. This seems
--> to be one of the main ideas in OOP. It is useful because it allows reusable bits of code to be altered to adapt
--> to the required functionality.

2. What is the benefit of making an empty abstract method in a base class?
--> It causes any classed based on that parent to implement a unique version of the method.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> I think it was the use of the abstract base classes. I think this is good insights into 'real' programming.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I asked for a way to simplify this
--> "if rand_int == 1 or rand_int == 2 or rand_int == 3:"
--> Chris F reminded me that I could use "if rand_int in range(1,4)"

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> I feel comfortable with the content at this point.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 hr
Checkpoint A - 0.5 hr
Checkpoint B - 0.5 hr
Team Activity - 1 hr
Data Structures Homework - 1.5 hr
Prove Assignment - 2 hr
