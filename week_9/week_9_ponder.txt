Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. Describe a case where you think an error/exception could be used, but should _not_ be used.
--> It seems that in the case of dividing by zero, an exception could be used but a better way
--> might be to just return 0 so the program can continue to run.

2. If method A calls B, and B calls C, and then an error is raised in function C, where can it potentially
be caught (A, B, C, or all of the above)?
--> Seems like it could be caught in any of those.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> It was good to learn about hashing.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I asked a question about how to approach the death of the bullet based on the frames.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> I would like to have done some assignment related to hashing. Easier to remember if we can apply the info.

Reading - 1 hr
Checkpoint A - 0.25 hr
Checkpoint B - 0.5 hr
