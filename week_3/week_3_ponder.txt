Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. In your own words, briefly describe what object-oriented programming means.
--> Object oriented programming is an efficient way to create modular bits of code that are easy to reuse.
--> In Python, instances of classes that contain variables and methods can be easily created.

2. What is the difference between a class and an object?
--> They are pretty similar. An object would have active variables and methods. A class is more of a template.
--> So an object would be an implemented class. But I think, also, everything in Python is considered an object.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> For the team activity I used the fractions library for reducing the rational number. I love that library.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I tried to help people with several issues, but one thing I asked for help with was for clarification on the
--> following requirement: Write a multiply_by function that accepts another rational number and changes the value
--> of the current object (multiply the two numerators to get the new numerator and the two denominators to get the
--> new denominator). Modify your main function to demonstrate it.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> I don't remembered if it was covered in the reading or I found it on my own, but I would like more information
--> on the use of 'super' when inheriting from a class into another class.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 3 hr
Checkpoint A - 1 hr
Checkpoint B - 1 hr
Team Activity - 3 hr
Data Structures Homework - 2 hr
Prove Assignment - 3 hr
