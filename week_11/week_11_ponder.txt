Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. In your own words describe polymorphism.
--> Polymorphism is when an object can have several differing implementations - each one
--> adapted to handle a task in a specific way.

2. Briefly describe how polymorphism is used in your project.
--> Here are a couple examples:
----> 1. The FlyingObj class uses the @abstractmethod to essentially force the use of polymorphism of
----> the 'def __str__' and the 'def draw' methods.
----> 2. The Asteroid base class has a 'def split' method that has differing implementations for the
----> small, medium, and large asteroids.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> I learned that you can use the 'def __str__' in a class to output specific information for when a
--> class is referenced.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I asked about the asteroids requirement of "Small asteroids should disappear" because it could have meant
--> that they disappear on their own after so many seconds. Michael A. indicated that they should not split,
--> but just vanish when shot.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> I feel fine about the information that was covered this week - no questions.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 hr (read stuff on my own)
Checkpoint A - 0.0 hr
Checkpoint B - 0.0 hr
Team Activity - 1 hr
Data Structures Homework - 0.5 hr
Prove Assignment - 5 hr
