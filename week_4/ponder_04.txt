Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. Besides the obvious aspect of writing fewer lines of code, what is a benefit of having a method call the methods
of an internal object, as opposed to doing the work itself? (E.g., Why is it beneficial for the get_subtotal method
of the Order class to make use of methods from the Product class?)
>>> This process seemed to mae iterating though the methods quick and easy. Like:
>>> for i in self.products:
>>>     s_total += i.get_total_price()


2. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
>>> Creating a list of objects and then looping though the methods in each of them.


3. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
>>> One of the other students was struggling to make a tar for his assign04 files. It was taring all his files in
>>> the parent directory. I helped him clean things up over a zoom meeting.


4. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
>>> I am feeling pretty good at the moment. More experience with classes would be good though.


5. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2
Checkpoint A - 1
Checkpoint B - 1
Team Activity - 2
Data Structures Homework - 2
Prove Assignment - 3
