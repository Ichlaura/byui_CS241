Your Name: Lewis Lockhart

1. Why would someone use a shell script instead of writing a Python program?
--> It seems like it would be useful for creating and populating file structures. If not that, it could be used
--> for looping through and searching for files in multiple directories.

2. Why would someone use a Python program instead of writing a shell script?
--> Python feels more intuitive/easy to use. It also seems to come with a larger set of libraries and
--> documentation.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--> I have used basic commands but never knew that Shell Script was actually a thing. I just thought of it
--> as Linux command line stuff.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--> I was able to help my group member, Chris, come up with ideas for what Shell Script might be useful
--> for in the real world. It is not really obvious.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--> I am not loving Shell Script or Data analysis. Shell script seemed to have been appended to the end of
--> this class because it did not fit into any other CS class. It feels ultra out of place.
